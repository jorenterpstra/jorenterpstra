- 👋 Hi, I’m @jorenterpstra
- 👀 AI techniques and methods interest me very much, more specifically Computer Vision and Machine Learning.
- 🌱 I am learning Kernel ELM and fisher vector encoding, and how to combine these topics with audio data.
- 📝 My current project is my undergraduate thesis, related to the topics mentioned above.
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate on anything at the moment, but that can always change in the future!
- 📫 If you want to, you can shoot me a message on my LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/joren-terpstra/
